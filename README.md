# ELC_4040_Control_project
Using MATLAB, design a compensator such that the closed-loop sampled data system has a phase margin of at least 50Â° and a gain margin of at least 10 dB. It is required to have a velocity error constant of 10. Plot and comment on the step-response of the compensated system.
